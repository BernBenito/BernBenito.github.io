								<p>I am <strong><i>Bernreiz Ann B. Benito, 19 year old,</i></strong> a Bachelor in Science in Information Technology Student(BSIT) in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig(PLP). <strong><i>Singing, Designing,</i></strong> and of course <strong><i>Sleeping</i></strong> has always been my hobby. I often do them during my free time as it helps me to feel relax. I am the eldest among my siblings, and my dream is to become a Web Designer.</p>
								<p>Web Designing caught my attention when I learned how to use technology, I find it cool everytime I see different kinds of websites with cool animations and designs, and my interest in Web Designing grew even bigger when I started to learn how to use html and css.</p>

							<h2>JOBS</h2>
							<p>My occupation of choice is <i>Web Designer and Software Developer</i>. I chose Web Designing and Software Development, because even though I donâ€™t know everything about computers and I'm not really good at understanding logics that fast. I am very hardworking and when I set my goal to something I strive hard to achieve it even though it takes a long time to achive it.</p>

							<h2>Strength and Weaknesses in terms of IT Field</h2>
							<p>Everyone has their own strength and weaknesses, and for me I think when it comes to <strong><i>DESIGNING</i></strong>, I can say that I'm not that bad which I believe is my <strong><i>STRENGTH</i></strong>, while understanding <strong><i>LOGIC</i></strong> is my greatest <strong><i>WEAKNESS</i></strong>, I've been struggling most of the time when lessons about logic are being discussed, I can understand it but, I forgot everything easily which makes it very hard for me to understand Logical related lessons in the field of IT.</p>

									<h2>Skills/Talents</h2>

							</div>
							<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
								<p>I believe everyone has unique skills and talents, and that is what makes each one of us special. People have skills in areas such as playing an instrument, playing sports, being artistic, acting, singing, and many more. People realize their talents at different stages in their lives. Giving back to the community by sharing the skill I have is what makes the difference. Everyone has at least one thing they are really good at. When each of us brings our individual talents together, the world becomes a masterpiece painting.</p>
								<p>I am proud to say that my special talent is <strong><i>Singing</i></strong>. It was a hobby as well as a talent that I think I can share to people. My parents used to listen to me singing all the time, I also once compete in a school singing competition and performed in school events. I can't say that I'm good, I just think that it's the only talent, that I'm quiet confident with to share.</p>
